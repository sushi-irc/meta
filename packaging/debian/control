Description: D-Bus-based IRC suite
 The sushi IRC suite consists of a central daemon and several clients, which
 communicate via DBus. DBus methods and signals are provided by the daemon to
 abstract the IRC protocol. Clients can use these methods and signals to easily
 interact with IRC.
 .
 This virtual package provides the full suite.
